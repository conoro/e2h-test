2-Step Verification turned on

Hi Conor,  
Congratulations on enabling 2-Step Verification for your Google Account  
[conorsblogposts@gmail.com](mailto:conorsblogposts@gmail.com)! We have a couple of suggestions to make sure you  
can always access your account.

\*Set up a backup phone\*  
If your primary phone is ever unavailable when you need a code, Google can  
send one to a backup, like your home or work phone or even a family  
member's phone. To set one up,

1\. Go to your 2-Step Verification settings  
<[https://accounts.google.com/AccountChooser?Email=conorsblogposts@gmail.com&continue=https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification?rfn%3D16%26rfnc%3D1%26eid%3D-4229223727680989389%26et%3D0%26asae%3D2>](https://accounts.google.com/AccountChooser?Email=conorsblogposts@gmail.com&continue=https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification?rfn%3D16%26rfnc%3D1%26eid%3D-4229223727680989389%26et%3D0%26asae%3D2>)  
page.  
2\. Click on \*Add a phone number\* in the \*Backup phones\* section.

\*Get backup codes\*  
If you don't have access to your primary or backup phones - such as when  
you're traveling - you can sign in with a backup code. You can keep them in  
your wallet or save them as a file on your computer. To get your backup  
codes,

1\. Go to your 2-Step Verification settings  
<[https://accounts.google.com/AccountChooser?Email=conorsblogposts@gmail.com&continue=https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification?rfn%3D16%26rfnc%3D1%26eid%3D-4229223727680989389%26et%3D0%26asae%3D2>](https://accounts.google.com/AccountChooser?Email=conorsblogposts@gmail.com&continue=https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification?rfn%3D16%26rfnc%3D1%26eid%3D-4229223727680989389%26et%3D0%26asae%3D2>)  
page.  
2\. Click on \*Show/Generate codes\*.
